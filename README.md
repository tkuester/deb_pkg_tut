# Debian Package Tutorial

Just a little toy project to help explain how Debian packages are built, with a
focus on cross compiling.

Please note, this is a TERRIBLE example of a Debian package! However, Debian
packages are immensely complicated, and large ones can be intimidating to start
digging into.

The goal of this project is to keep things small and manageable, and serve as a
teaching tool. Perhaps it will be easier to understand how to correctly design
a debian package after studying a bad one! 

I've documented some of the process and decisions made in the brief git
history. It's well worth a quick read through the diffs to see what changed,
and why.
